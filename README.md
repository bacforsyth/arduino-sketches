ds18b20_temp_sensor_and_lcd
===========================
Read the temperature from a DS18B20 1wire temperature sensor and displays the
result on a [jeelabs lcd plug](http://jeelabs.org/lp1)

LCD is on port 4, temp sensor is on port 1. Sends temp x 10 via RF12 module as
well.

The start of a project that tries to emulate the [Evil Mad Scientist
Snap-o-Lantern]( http://www.evilmadscientist.com/2007/make-a-robotic-snap-o-lantern/)

Servos are on port 2 and 3, I forget which is right and left though.
